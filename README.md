<h2> (Update!) The Truth</h2>

(Wondering if this will help a certain somebody) (Just saying)

Well, this is awkward... turns out that Scratch is now blocked for good at my school. No more using Chromebook for that, sadly.

And there are no bypasses or alternatives to get around this, so if you guide me on how to get the website unblocked, don't. It won't work.

Sincerely,
