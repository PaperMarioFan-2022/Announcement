<h2>The Truth</h2>


Please feel free to stop by and discuss this if you can, because this isn't very good news. Logan has the same problem.

Last week, the head admins that controls our school computers decided that it would be a good idea to block scratch.mit.edu for whatever reason, and I don't like the new change, but it has made me a better person, in all honesty. In fact, the ban was rather fair since I haven't payed a lot of attention on school more, so I'd say that it's a good choice on them. I apologize again for not telling any of you on scratch or through github for the past few weeks, but I can't do anything about it, and I am full blown (temporarily) banned from using any other devices that have internet access to the web, I know it's kind of stupid for that to happen to a guy like me, but it happens. That's life for ya'll.

Now since that I am away from Scratch for a few weeks, I have decided to move on to GitHub and hopefully communicate there, that way, I don't have to use Scratch to and avoid getting muted or banned again (that rarely happens now or then, but it does happen eventually), but don't worry, I am totally capable of getting myself an appeal and unbanning myself. People who are reporting me for false reasons and whatnow are going against Scratch Team's CGs on their behalf.

In other words, I won't be able to fully be present on Scratch until I graduate from my school, meaning that I am going to have to spend another year, without communication or contact on Scratch, and that hurts me a lot, too.

I will have alternatives to get passed the blocking of Scratch and it won't be the end of the world for me, but for now, I am unable to use Scratch at this time, on my original chromebook that is borrowed from my high school.

Until then, Scratch on!

Sincerely,
